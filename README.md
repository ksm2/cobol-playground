COBOL Playground
================

[COBOL] is a legacy programming language that has been widely used in business, finance, and administrative systems for
decades. Despite its age, COBOL remains in use today, particularly in mainframe environments.

This repository provides a simple COBOL playground where you can write, compile, and run COBOL code snippets. It is
intended for educational purposes, allowing users to experiment with COBOL syntax and features.


## Prerequisites

Install a COBOL compiler, such as [GnuCOBOL]. You can find installation instructions on their website.

For macOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install gnu-cobol
```
